Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

Easy MLA formatting

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?

Citing online sources by inputing the URL of the website and retrieving the required amount of
information to create a proper citation.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

I will learn how to strip websites for information and how to formate that information
into a certain readable format.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)

my program would use the datetime, csv, pytest modules and possibly more.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

Yes, for a program with this many moving parts I will definitely be breaking it down into
smaller functions that do their own jobs.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?

(Remember that it's hard to test functions that get user input and print
output. It's easy to test functions that don't get user input and don't
print output but instead have parameters and return a result. Therefore,
you should write most of your program functions to have parameters and
return a result.)

I have plans to write test functions for all of the functions I plan on writing, However
I am not sure that I will know how to write a test function for all of them. I will request
the adequate help when appropriate.
