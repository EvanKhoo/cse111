Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

    When working learning to work with dictionaries during the chemistry assignment
it struck me how important functions are to dealing with large amounts of data
and information. They helped break down problems and make them easily managable and
easier to maintain which is great for large problems. It also makes finding, identifying
and fixing bugs a lot easier as they are typically more self contained and lead a trail
straight back to their function of origin.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

    Test functions are great for testing normal functinos on a large range of variables
and unpredictable inputs. This helps ensure that functions are working the way they are 
supposed to and do not break unless under very extreme circumstances. Test functions also
helps standardize quality and helps ensure that everything is up to the same expected
quality level.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

    I typically start by looking at the exact thing I just changed when a bug appears paired 
with looking at the error codes that typically accompanie a bug. I do not use the VS code
debugging feature as much as I should as it is incredibly useful and strong. From there I 
back track my steps to ensure that there are no syntax and errors and search for the exact line
of problem through a bit of hide and seek/trial and error. When it comes to actually solving 
a coding problem a lot of it is trial and error, but I also do a lot of research on the exact
kind of problem that I am dealing with and look at how others have dealt and fixed the problem.
From there I adapt others solutions to the problem to better fit my code.
